    <li>
        Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.
    </li>
    
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903. 
    </li>

        The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.

    <li>
        Washable teddy bears didn't appear until 1954 when the stuffing was switched to an easier to clean nylon fill. Before that, they were stuffed with mohair, wool, and other hard to clean fills.
